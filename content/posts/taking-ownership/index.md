I think the biggest shift in the way I was thinking about software development was when I started being asked, 
"How do you know this works?". All the way up until then you and I might have asked the answered the same way,
"I tested it. QA tested it, both in development and in production. It has to be working". While I think this is
totallly valid on the surface, there's a larger, more obvious picture that we should be looking at: "Yes but what
effect is any of your work making?".

Do you know how your product is doing? How is performing? When working with real production software these the
questions you have to start asking yourself. At Crunchyroll I worked on the payments team. That meant that my
team and I were responsible for all the subscription money that came through the service. How do we know that
any of our changes were generating any additional revenue or god forbid, losing the company revenue? Of course
it's probably some manager's job to know that, they could certainly generate revenue reports from
our payment processors, but who's to say that there aren't descrepancies between what they report and we
should be seeing? That's when it becomes the developers' responsiblity to be able to answer these questions.

To take ownership of your work is two parts for me. Taking the time to understand your product and think of how to improve it, 
and to know how it is performing. These two feed into each other in a constant cycle. The better you know how the product is performing, 
the better you understand it and how to improve it, and as you improve it, the more you see its performance improve. It may obvious but if 
you're not personally asking yourself these questions, then you're just completing tasks as they're written out without understanding the 
context in which they were created.
