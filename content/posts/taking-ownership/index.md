I think the biggest shift in the way I was thinking about software development was when I started being asked, 
"How do you know this works?". All the way up until then you and I might have asked the answered the same way,
"I tested it. QA tested it, both in development and in production. It has to be working". While I think this is
totallly valid on the surface, there's a larger, more obvious picture that we should be looking at: "Yes but
how do you know it 'works'?".

Do you know how your product is doing? How is performing? How do you show this information to other
people? When working with software that's been released publicly these the questions I ask myself. 
At Crunchyroll I worked on the payments team. That meant that my team and I were responsible for all 
the subscription money that came through the service. Unless we knew how much money was coming through, 
or how many free trial and subscription sign ups we were getting, how could we feel like our work mattered?

To take ownership of your work is two parts for me. Taking the time to understand your product and think of how to improve it, and to know how it is performing. These two feed into each other in a constant cycle. The better you know how the product is performing, the better you understand it and how to improve it, and as you improve it, the more you see its performance improve. It may obvious but if you're not personally asking yourself these questions, then you're just completing tasks as they're written out without understanding the context in which they were created.
