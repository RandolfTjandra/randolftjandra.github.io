&ldquo;How do you know this works?&rdquo;. All the way up until then you and I might have asked the answered the same way,
&ldquo;I tested it. QA tested it, both in development and in production. It has to be working&rdquo;. While I think this is
totallly valid on the surface, there&rsquo;s a larger, more obvious picture that we should be looking at: &ldquo;Yes but what
effect is any of your work making?&rdquo;.</p><p>Do you know how your product is doing? How is performing? When working with real production software these the
questions you have to start asking yourself. At Crunchyroll I worked on the payments team. That meant that my
team and I were responsible for all the subscription money that came through the service. How do we know that
any of our changes were generating any additional revenue or god forbid, losing the company revenue? Of course
it&rsquo;s probably some manager&rsquo;s job to know that, they could certainly generate revenue reports from
our payment processors, but who&rsquo;s to say that there aren&rsquo;t descrepancies between what they report and we
should be seeing? What if there&rsquo;s a service outage? These are the times it becomes the developers&rsquo; responsiblity to be
able to answer these questions and in fact, be proactive about monitoring these
results.</p><p>The great thing about working on live products is that it&rsquo;s pretty easy to
monitor for irregularities. I had set up logs for our payment service for
several key events, the most hotly observed ones were: <code>Free Trial Checkout Succeeded</code> and <code>Subscription Checkout succeeded</code>. Just from these two event logs
I could have a log aggregator like Sumo Logic<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup> parse and graph them for me so I
could create dashboards that showed metrics that represented all the successful
checkouts on the site through our services over the past week.</p><p>When observing this data you&rsquo;ll notice that, &ldquo;ok the checkouts are cylic. People
just aren&rsquo;t furiously paying for anime in the middle of the night&rdquo;. From there
we can generate additional charts that show things like, how does this week&rsquo;s
checkouts compare to the last. If this week is consistently higher, that&rsquo;s good
news, something right is going with the product. We potentially put something
out that we should be proud of as team. Your change, or project, can directly be
correlated empirically with the continued success of your service; own it! If it&rsquo;s
not, then let&rsquo;s have a conversation about it. If we can pin it to a specific
deployment, we should go back and look at its content and see if we can resolve
any unwanted causation. I found that there was so much power in this
information. We can also create charts that show when checkouts deviate negatively from
standard deviation, and most importantly we can create alerts on these. A really
important weapon we possess to prevent further damage to the product.</p><p>When I started building out these dashboards and alerts, the way I approached feature
development started to revolve around these concepts. I would make sure that the
tasks that I specc&rsquo;d out would contain requirements that asked the developer
that they implement some way to monitor the outcome of their changes and call
them out if it was missing. It may not seem like a big deal for those of you
that already think about development like this, but to me there&rsquo;s a big
difference in solely thinking about how to solve some engineering problem, and
how to think like a product owner that cares about their service results</p><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p>Unfortunately I can&rsquo;t show you any of these charts as examples <a href=https://www.sumologic.com/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Sumo Logic</a>&#160;<a href=#fnref:1 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li></ol></div></div><div class=tags><a href=https://randolftjandra.github.io/tags/software_development>software_development</a></div></section></main><footer id=footer><div id=social><a class=symbol href=https://www.github.com/randolftjandra rel=me target=_blank><svg fill="#bbb" width="28" height="28" viewBox="0 0 72 72" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"><title>Github</title><desc>Created with Sketch.</desc><defs/><g id="Page-1" stroke="none" stroke-width="1" fill="none" fill-rule="evenodd"><g id="Social-Icons---Rounded-Black" transform="translate(-264.000000, -939.000000)"><g id="Github" transform="translate(264.000000, 939.000000)"><path d="M8 72H64c4.418278.0 8-3.581722 8-8V8c0-4.418278-3.581722-8-8-8H8c-4.418278 811624501e-24-8 3.581722-8 8V64c541083001e-24 4.418278 3.581722 8 8 8z" id="Rounded" fill="#bbb"/><path d="M35.9985 13C22.746 13 12 23.7870921 12 37.096644c0 10.6440272 6.876 19.6751861 16.4145 22.8617681C29.6145 60.1797862 30.0525 59.4358488 30.0525 58.7973276 30.0525 58.2250681 30.0315 56.7100863 30.0195 54.6996482c-6.6765 1.4562499-8.085-3.2302544-8.085-3.2302544-1.0905-2.7829884-2.664-3.5239139-2.664-3.5239139C17.091 46.4500754 19.4355 46.4801943 19.4355 46.4801943c2.4075.1701719 3.675 2.4833051 3.675 2.4833051 2.142 3.6820383 5.6175 2.6188404 6.9855 2.0014024C30.3135 49.4077535 30.9345 48.3460615 31.62 47.7436831 26.2905 47.1352808 20.688 45.0691228 20.688 35.8361671c0-2.6308879.9345-4.781379 2.4705-6.4665327C22.911 28.7597262 22.0875 26.3110578 23.3925 22.9934585c0 0 2.016-.6475568 6.6 2.4697516C31.908 24.9285993 33.96 24.6620468 36.0015 24.6515052 38.04 24.6620468 40.0935 24.9285993 42.0105 25.4632101c4.581-3.1173084 6.5925-2.4697516 6.5925-2.4697516C49.9125 26.3110578 49.089 28.7597262 48.8415 29.3696344 50.3805 31.0547881 51.309 33.2052792 51.309 35.8361671c0 9.2555448-5.6115 11.29309-10.9575 11.8894446.860999999999997.7439374 1.629 2.2137408 1.629 4.4621184C41.9805 55.4089489 41.9505 58.0067059 41.9505 58.7973276 41.9505 59.4418726 42.3825 60.1918338 43.6005 59.9554002 53.13 56.7627944 60 47.7376593 60 37.096644 60 23.7870921 49.254 13 35.9985 13" fill="#FFF"/></g></g></g></svg>
