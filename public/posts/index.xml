      <description>Inspired by a former mentor of mine, I set up this alias in my .gitconfig file.&#xA;lg = log --graph --abbrev-commit --decorate --date=relative --format=format:&amp;#39;%C(bold blue)%h%C(reset) - %C(bold green)(%ar)%C(reset) %C(white)%s%C(reset) %C(dim white)- %an%C(reset)%C(bold yellow)%d%C(reset)&amp;#39; --all When you run this you see every commit on your project&amp;rsquo;s git commit tree. You see every branch that belongs to you and every other contributor&amp;rsquo;s branches on origin in a single view. For me this is a way to observe my team&amp;rsquo;s work progress from a high level.</description>

      <description>I come from experience where the work we did was documented on Jira. The task description, requirements, and QA procedure were all recorded there. This is useful as non developer stakeholders usually do not have access to a project&amp;rsquo;s git commit history. Besides, who wants to navigate through git just to see what work is being done?&#xA;I like to think that commit messages should be as succinct as possible. It should only describe the content of the work.</description>
